            <h1>Rules of Blackjack</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Card Values:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.</li>
                <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</li>
                <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable to the player's hand.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Deal:</strong> The dealer gives each player, including themselves, two cards face up. They take two cards as well, but one is face down (the "hole card").</li>
        <li><strong>Player's Turn:</strong> Starting from the player to the dealer's left, each player decides whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Players can continue to hit until they decide to stand or until their hand exceeds 21, resulting in a "bust," which means an automatic loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Dealer's Turn:</strong> After all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. If the dealer's hand is 16 or less, they must hit; if it's 17 or more, they must stand.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning Conditions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player's hand beats the dealer's hand without exceeding 21, they win and are paid out at even money.</li>
                <li>If the player's hand totals 21 with their first two cards (an Ace plus a 10-value card), this is called "blackjack," and they usually win at higher odds (often 3:2 or 6:5).</li>
                <li>If the player and dealer have the same hand total, it's a "push," and the player's bet is returned.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Special Plays:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"Split": If a player's first two cards are of the same rank (e.g., two 7s), they can split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet.</li>
                <li>"Double Down": After receiving the first two cards, a player can double their bet and receive exactly one additional card.</li>
                <li>"Insurance": If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, players can make a side bet (usually half their original bet) that the dealer has blackjack. This bet pays out 2:1 if the dealer indeed has blackjack.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Busting:</strong> If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose immediately, regardless of the dealer's hand.</li>
    </ol>
