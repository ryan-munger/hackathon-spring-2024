# Marist Computer Society Hackathon Spring 2024!
Team: Ryan Munger & Abel Scholl

This project is a web application with the theme of card games. You can play card games, learn about how to play them, and even get assistance in strategic decisions.
Main feature: a fully playable and functional blackjack game.
Other features: assistants for Pokemon, MTG, Poker, and YuGiOh. The GoFish UI was not able to be completed by the deadline, but it is still mostly functional.

Requirements: Web browser.
